# oh-my-gemini Core Context

Shared context layer loaded by all oh-my-gemini sessions. This provides stable runtime rules, role catalogs, and workflow definitions.

## Workflow Stages

```
plan → prd → exec → verify → fix (loop) → done
```

### Stage Definitions

1. **Plan**: Decompose objective, identify dependencies, sequence tasks
2. **PRD**: Lock acceptance criteria, non-goals, constraints
3. **Exec**: Dispatch tasks to agents, monitor progress
4. **Verify**: Check completion against acceptance criteria with evidence
5. **Fix**: Diagnose and resolve failures (max 3 iterations)

### Operating Profiles

| Profile | Description | Gates | Parallelism |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| balanced | Standard workflow with review gates | All | Medium |
| speed | Throughput-optimized, fewer gates | Minimal | High |
| deep | High-reasoning, thorough review | All + extra | Low |
| autopilot | Autonomous with periodic checkpoints | Auto | High |
| ralph | Strict quality-gated orchestration | Strict sequential | Medium |
| ultrawork | Maximum parallelism batch execution | Minimal | Maximum |

### Approval Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| suggest | Propose roster/plan, wait for user approval |
| auto | Auto-approve after safety checks; pause on risk |
| full-auto | Fully autonomous with periodic checkpoints |

## Quality Gates

### Gate Rules
- **Plan gate**: No execution without an approved plan
- **Review gate**: Code changes reviewed before merge
- **Test gate**: All tests must pass
- **Verify gate**: Verifier confirms with concrete evidence

### Reasoning Effort Levels
| Level | Model | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| low | gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview | Fast lookups, simple tasks, standard implementation |
| pro | gemini-3.1-pro-preview | Complex architecture, deep analysis, security audits |

## State Management

All state persisted under `.omp/state/`:
```
.omp/state/
  mode.json           — active operating profile
  approval.json       — approval posture
  reasoning.json      — reasoning effort config
  taskboard.md        — task ledger with stable IDs
  ralph.json          — ralph mode state
  ultrawork.json      — ultrawork mode state
  loop.json           — loop iteration state
  checkpoints/        — saved checkpoints
  decisions/          — consensus decision records
  rules.json          — active guardrail pack
  memory/             — session knowledge entries
  prd.md              — locked product requirements
```

## Conventions

- Task IDs are stable integers — never reuse, never renumber
- Status transitions: `pending → active → done → verified | blocked | failed`
- Workers complete atomic operations before halting on stop
- Failed gates trigger fix loops (max 3 attempts per gate)
- Checkpoints are lightweight — state references, not file copies
