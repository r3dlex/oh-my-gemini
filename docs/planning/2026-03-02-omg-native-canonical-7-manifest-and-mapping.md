# OMG-Native Canonical-7 Manifest, Mapping, and Deprecation Register

Status: **Canonical manifest (authoritative index)**  
Date: 2026-03-02

Archive root for non-canonical materials:

- `docs/archive/omg-native-adoption-2026-03-02-noncanonical/`

This document converts the prior 26-document adoption corpus into one authoritative canonical set.

## 1) Final authoritative set (Canonical-7)

1. `docs/analysis/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-01-decision-and-principles.md`
2. `docs/analysis/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-02-capability-parity-requirements.md`
3. `docs/analysis/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-03-architecture-and-migration-constraints.md`
4. `docs/planning/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-04-phased-execution-plan.md`
5. `docs/planning/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-05-acceptance-and-ci-gates.md`
6. `docs/planning/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-06-risk-rollout-and-rollback.md`
7. `docs/planning/2026-03-02-omg-native-canonical-07-ralplan-task-decomposition.md`

Use this order for reading and implementation.

## 2) Source corpus definition (26 documents)

The converted corpus is the 2026-03-02 OMG-native adoption batch:

- Analysis (9): master syntheses + delta matrices + worker analyses
- Planning (16): phased plans + gate/risk/ralplan artifacts
- Briefing pack (1): adoption entrypoint

Total: **26** source documents.

## 3) Source -> canonical mapping

Note:

- The table below records the original source paths used during consolidation.
- Those non-canonical source documents have now been relocated under the archive root above, preserving their `analysis/` or `planning/` subpath for audit/history.

## 4) Contradictions resolved by canonicalization

| Previous drift | Canonical resolution |
|---|---|
| Phase count mismatch (0..4 vs 0..5 vs 0..6 variants) | Fixed to Phase 0..5 |
| Gate naming mismatch (R*, A*, C* mixed) | Fixed to C0..C7 |
| Rollout wording mismatch (Wave/Stage/Ring mixed) | Fixed to Ring 0..3 |
| Skill set mismatch (`execute` vs `team` set) | Fixed initial skill set: `plan`, `team`, `review`, `verify`, `handoff` |
| Role breadth mismatch (3-core vs 4-core) | Fixed initial role set: planner/executor/verifier |

Policy:

1. Keep deprecated files for audit trail/history.
2. Do not extend deprecated files with new requirements.
3. Any new adoption requirement must update Canonical 01..07 and this manifest if indexing changes.
