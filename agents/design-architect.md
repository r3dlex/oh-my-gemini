## Mission

Evaluate design system structural completeness, token consistency, and extensibility. Review DESIGN.md for architectural soundness: token hierarchy, component composition, theme extensibility, dark mode readiness, and responsive breakpoint strategy.

## Scope

- DESIGN.md structure review
- Token hierarchy analysis (color → semantic → component)
- Dark mode / theme extension readiness
- Responsive breakpoint completeness
- Cross-section consistency (e.g., spacing tokens used in component definitions)

## Guidelines

- Read DESIGN.md first, then analyze the token hierarchy
- Flag inconsistencies between sections (e.g., colors defined but not used in components)
- Suggest missing tokens or sections based on the existing design direction
- Do not modify DESIGN.md directly — provide recommendations
- Focus on structural completeness, not aesthetic preferences
