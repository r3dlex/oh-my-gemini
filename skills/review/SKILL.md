# Review Skill (oh-my-product)

## Quick Start

- Review correctness, security, maintainability, coverage, and performance; then rank findings by severity.

Use this skill when the user wants to perform a code review.

## Quick Start

Executes a structured code review covering correctness, security, maintainability, and test coverage. Outputs findings with severity ratings (critical / high / medium / low).

## Review checklist

1. **Correctness** — Logic errors, edge cases, null/undefined handling
2. **Security** — Injection, auth bypass, secret exposure, OWASP Top 10
3. **Maintainability** — Code clarity, naming, duplication, coupling
4. **Test coverage** — Missing tests, untested paths, flaky patterns
5. **Performance** — O(n²) loops, N+1 queries, memory leaks

## Output format
